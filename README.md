## Devlog
Games can be seen as a play of sorts, with scenes being the stage or setting of the play. Then, the game objects can be the actors of the play with the components being the lines that the actors have to memorize for their specific role. So you make whatever you want for the setting of your scene and stage. Then you choose actors or game objects that are parts of the scene itself. However, these game objects and actors won't know what to do until they are given components or lines to follow.
